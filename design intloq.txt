design notes intelloquium

Segment: which group?
- name
- segname[1-n]
- questions[1-n][1-k]
- conduit[1-n]

Purpose: what to achieve?
- name
- intent

Relationship: between contacts
- name
- source (contact)
- destination (contact)

Conduit:
unaware -> aware -> belief -> decision -> action/use

Influence on belief (Kelman):
- compliance: means-control (reward is social effect)
- identification: attractiveness (reward is act of conforming) - conformity: matching attitudes, beliefs, behaviors to group norms (Asch conformity: 1% error rate vs. 37%)
- internalization: credibility (reward is content of the new)

probability of accepting influence in general: a combination of 3 determinants:
- relative importance of anticipated effect (surveillance for compliance, salience of relationship for identification, relevance of values for internalization)
- relative power of influencing agent (social rewards, satisfying relationships, value maximization)
- prepotency (= exceptional power of influence) of induced response (external demands, expectations on role, value system)

our need to be
- right
- liked

1. Purpose: I want to reach a goal

2. define target contacts: Who is relevant to achieving the goal? This might grow later...

3. define stages to goal: e.g. final stage = decision, first stage is unaware of.... with aware and belief in between = conduit; should also include observations (or markers) to correctly identify the stage the contact is in

4. define actions to move contacts from stage to stage (stage jump): What might confirm a stage jump? contact might say something while I am present, but that is authority, will need identification or internalization: will need good markers for both, identification = ETHOS: we share the same values, I want to conform; internalization = PATHOS: thinking this way makes me feel good

5. since contacts are different by character, markers for a stage and the action that triggers a stage jump might be different by contact character: define segments: groupings of contacts by similar stage observations/markers and similar stage-jumping actions; possibly later augment with a typing tool to ID markers and segment participation;

6. define relationships between contacts to determine indirect influence possibilities: need to know: direction of influence, + or -, might be restricted to certain actions or influence types, strength of influence: +1 leads to +0.3 at target (or loss function), time delay (depends on frequency of interaction between contacts)

Why not just have + and - as action? provide a report or a question when a stage limit has been reached, otherwise false exactness? we could forgoe all the details and just log + and -: then define hard gates: e.g. sale closed and correlate this with the actions before; from this we can derive a probability for a win based on the action bar progress; or better: just + to indicate stage jump, a button with a number for action (number = number of actions taken), forgoe progrss bar;
